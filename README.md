# Social Network Ads: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to predict whether a user will purchase a product advertised on a social network. The SVM model is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

The goal of this project, a term assignment for CS 364 Machine Learning, is to design, implement, and evaluate an SVM model to classify data from the ***Social_Network_Ads.csv dataset***. The project demonstrates key machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Files

  - **SVM_model.ipynb:** The main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python source code. It includes all steps from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.
  - **Social_Network_Ads.csv:** The dataset used for the project. It contains user data such as User ID, Gender, Age, and Estimated Salary, along with a target variable ***(Purchased)*** indicating whether the user bought the product.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

  - Python
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - The following Python libraries: **numpy**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.
    
You can install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip install notebook numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Execution

1. Ensure the ***SVM_model.ipynb*** notebook and the ***Social_Network_Ads.csv*** file are in the same directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. In the Jupyter Notebook interface that opens in your browser, click on ***SVM_model.ipynb*** to open it.
5. Run all the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the full workflow, from data loading to model evaluation and visualization.
